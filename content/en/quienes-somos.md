Political Watch is an independent organisation with a global outlook, based in Spain. We specialise in researching social change, political advocacy and the development of pro-democratic technology. We push for public policies that are more transparent and participatory, thereby making them more effective. Our work looks to the democracy of the future, while also building alliances to improve the institutions of today.

Ours is a passionate and unapologetically nerdy team. We are a group of good people doing something we believe in, and giving it our all. Based in Madrid, Catalonia and Andalucia, weâ€™re always in tune with our local surroundings.
