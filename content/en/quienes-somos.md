Political Watch is an independent organisation with a global outlook, based in Spain. We specialise in research for social change, political advocacy and the development of pro-democratic technology. We Promote public policies that are transparent, participatory, and more effective. Our work imagines the democracy of tomorrow while forging alliances to strengthen the institutions of today.

Ours is a passionate and unapologetically nerdy team. We are a group of good people doing something we believe in, and giving it our all. Based in Madrid, Catalonia and Andalucia, weâ€™re always in tune with our local surroundings.
