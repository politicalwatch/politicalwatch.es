  subtitle: "Paying attention to the demands of Spain’s rural areas"
  description: "Under the research line PIA2022 of COTEC Foundation, we examined the social demands coming from rural territories of Spain to tackle inequality, analyzing how their petitions have been portrayed in the media and debated in the parliament in the last years. This study combines different methodologies, such as the conduction of interviews or the use of civic technologies, to shed light on the inequalities affecting the rural population."

    description: "We designed an online search tool that displays the time in the news and divulgative programmes broadcasted by RTVE dedicated to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. To measure this, we use Radar ODS, an AI-powered technology that classifies all types of content. Citizens and civil society organizations can navigate the website to know how the targets and goals of 2030 Agenda are being addressed, visualizing interactive graphs and comparing programmes."

    description: "We started a civic tech tool that systematizes, classifies and shows in a simple and accessible manner everything happening at the Congreso de los Diputados. Thus, we promote civic monitoring and accountability of our institutions, designing an open website to consult the information, extract data and generate reports. QHLD has been used by academia, by civil society organizations and by citizens, making everyday an open day at the Spanish parliament."
