Running is Javier’s greatest passion, his source of balance and inspiration. Born on the MIT Campus in Boston and raised in the Madrid neighbourhood of Vallecas, Javier’s origins are a unique bouillabaisse of privilege, humility and integrity which, all mixed together, explain how he became who he is today.

He began his career in international development organisations, where he combined social research with activism. Eventually, the fields of civic participation and technology became the perfect niche from which to pursue his twin obsessions: the fights against inequality and social injustice.

Despite his strong track record in public advocacy and citizen innovation, he is known first and foremost for his love of writing carefully worded emails, and for coming up with fun names for new projects.
