An unrepentantly curious soul, Celia is just as likely to bend your ear about handball as urban planning, vintage interiors or circular fashion. Jane Jacobs is her capeless hero.

Celia graduated with a degree in Information Sciences (i.e. journalism) and has a postgrad degree in electoral communication – as well as street smarts when it comes to matters of social transformation. A restless person, you could say that her upbringing on the wide open plains of inland Spain has given her an appreciation of broad horizons (and rain).

Celia started out in humanitarian NGOs, and now endeavours to humanise political communication. She's a big believer in the power of the municipality, and of life lived on a local level. At Amnesty International, she learned that if criticism is coming from all sides, you’re probably doing something right. She always communicates with the common good in mind, and is an expert at connecting causes to unlikely outcomes.
