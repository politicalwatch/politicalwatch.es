If Thai had to define herself in one word, it would be feminist. She is passionate about building, upholding, enabling and invigorating ecosystems of people, organisations and movements to generate collective intelligence in support of democracy and social justice.

An engineer by training, Thai is also a higher-study addict, with four postgrad degrees to her name. She has spent the last 20 years working towards a democracy that is fairer, more inclusive and more participatory. Before joining Political Watch she worked in Germany, Colombia, Morocco and Spain, with organisations such as Oxfam and Open Society Foundations. Thai is a true woman of action: she co-founded Algorights and ParticipationAI, and has been involved in organisation at all levels, from international networks to local grassroots campaigns. She has even mobilised an entire town – megaphone in hand – in support of participatory budgets.

Her moral compass can be summarised in two phrases: _“The privileged are processed more by people, the masses by machines”_ (Cathy O´Neil) and _“That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love”_ (Rose, Star Wars).
