A natural-born feminist geek, Belén is a big fan of role-playing games and anime. Her dream is to travel, weaving inspiring experiences across the four corners of the earth.

She resolutely believes that, even in the worst of times, it’s never too late to design an exciting, empowering future. She dedicates her time to researching what this future might look like and, above all, what a truly inclusive democracy would mean.

Belén’s work combines the technical with the political – empathy and frustration in the face of inequality drive her to generate knowledge that is truly useful and actionable. Despite her training in international relations and public policy management, she has always learned the most by listening to those who surround her.
