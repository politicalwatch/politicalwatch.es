A devout globalist and uncanny imitator of accents, Christian can recognise all of the world’s flags.

He holds a master’s degree in Political and Electoral Analysis, and specialised in democratic quality, civic participation and transparency. He spends a good chunk of his days checking up on what our representatives are doing (or not doing) in Congress, and translating this into data and proposals to improve our democracy. His toolkit includes the programming language R, as well as patience and a fascination for legislative details that borders on the unhealthy.

Christian is troubled by the disaffection and polarisation that have made minefields out of so many dinner table conversations. For fun, he bounces between tennis and techno, and cries at films that some might call “boring”. He was born in a city that exemplifies the magnificence of chaos, and lives according to the expression _“whatever you’re not changing, you’re choosing.”_
