Virginia is an unconventional political scientist who, like any good Argentinian, loves astrology and yerba mate. She struggles to define herself, both on principle and because she encompasses such a wide range of roles and interests.

Virginia holds a master's degree in Local Development, and is currently pursuing another in Communication and Architectural Mediation. She is passionate about urban policy and public spaces that foster civic conversation, collaboration and care.

Her role in Political Watch is hybrid in nature, centred in particular on the design of learning experiences, dialogue and civic participation to create solutions out of public innovation.

Virginia sees intensity as a virtue, and civic innovation as the seed of transformation.
