Miguel knows all the cheesy pop songs on Kiss FM, but don’t expect him to audition for The Voice any time soon. A lover of nature, a vegan and an animal rights activist, Miguel dreams of a more sustainable world. He loves watching international films at home (no dubbing, only subtitles please) with a bowl of popcorn in his lap.

A trained programmer, he has spent over 10 years working in all kinds of sectors, from cars to crypto, energy and banking.

Today, Miguel turns complex ideas and abstract needs into functioning technological solutions by designing and developing apps that actually help the people who use them. Equal parts analytical and creative, he enjoys keeping up with current events, and takes time to research the latest methodologies, languages and tools. After all, life moves pretty fast – if you don’t stop to look around once in a while, you could miss the chance to make the best world possible.
