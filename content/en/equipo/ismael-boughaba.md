Ismael keeps a keen eye on European democracy, ready to spot any faultlines that could open up and give authoritarianism a foothold. Unabashedly nerdy in his devotion to politics, he’s quite happy to sacrifice a night’s sleep to wait up for election results.

Ismael has studied in Rabat, Buenos Aires, Brussels and Bruges, with two master’s degrees guiding him through a career that spans the private sector and public institutions. With six languages under his belt, he can also hop between political contexts with ease. He is especially passionate about the intersection of democracy and the climate, and believes that, with climate change already beyond the point of no return, the most sensible thing is to prepare for what’s to come in a fair, democratic way. Just like going on a big night out or running a half marathon, you can either rush headlong into it, or you can prepare and handle it well.

Ismael spends his free time collecting maps, exploring the world of wine, and getting just as stuck into museums as he does parliamentary debates. Travelling abroad is his window into other cultures, and lets him see what democracy looks like in different contexts. He is adamant that cities themselves reflect politics and social change far better than most reports.
