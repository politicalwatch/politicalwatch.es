Andalusian through and through, Pablo is a connoisseur of fine food. Faced with the dilemma of whether to study Social Work or Computer Engineering, Pablo wound up specialising in Artificial Intelligence. Guided by principles of social innovation and the potential of new technology to redistribute wealth, he uses his skills and know-how to fight for a fairer world.

A staunch advocate for the power of free knowledge in emancipating the people, he found civic technologies to be the secret weapon for improving democratic systems, making them more open and collaborative.

This perennial commitment to the people, and to mutual support among peers, is his raison d’être. This is what reading Kropotkin does to a person – other people’s pain is now his own.belen
