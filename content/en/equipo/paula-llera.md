Asturian by birth, Madrid is now Paula's adoptive home. She gets FOMO if she goes a day without listening to the radio and can talk endlessly about Eurovision and its political ramifications. In her free time, she volunteers at an anti-poverty organisation.

Paula designs and executes advocacy plans, galvanising relations with other civil society platforms and organisations. She is a staunch defender of article 23.1 of the Spanish Constitution (the right to democracy and universal suffrage), and believes that strength is found in unity. She is concerned by growing political disaffection, which is what led her to work on helping governments and administrations to innovate and establish dialogue with citizens.

She is a double graduate in International Studies and Political Science, and is currently studying law. She also has a masterâ€™s degree in International Development Cooperation and has completed courses in journalism.
