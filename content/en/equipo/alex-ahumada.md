A passionate lover of music, Alex abuses both the double bass and bass guitar as a member of Music Komité. Spend more than 15 minutes in his company and he’ll likely recommend at least one of Ursula K. Le Guin’s books. He’s as Andalusian as they come, though you wouldn’t know it from his singing voice.

As far as we’re concerned, Alex is a software engineer with over 15 years of experience at the intersection of tech, design and civic innovation. He has mainly worked in public institutions, using digital tools to improve transparency, accountability and participation. For Alex, technology is a vital tool for improving people’s lives, even if it’s often, sadly, used for the exact opposite purpose.

A graduate of IT Engineering from UNED, he is currently studying a master’s degree in Engineering and Data Science. Though today he can barely hold a pencil, in a past life he studied Multimedia Design and Production at Escuela Arte in Granada, and has a Diploma in Motion Graphics from the Escola Superior de Disseny.
