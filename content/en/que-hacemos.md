### Ampliando Democracia (Expanding Democracy)

Ampliando Democracia is an innovative platform that uses public participation to produce scalable democratic solutions. Through deliberation methods and collective intelligence, we connect actors from a range of sectors to nail down public policy proposals, and to create sustainable, democratic infrastructures. Our unique value proposal lies in turning civic dialogue into measurable impacts.

Backing this initiative means investing in stronger democracies that are better prepared for the challenges of today, such as the rise of authoritarianism. This project seeks a future where civic participation isn’t just some lofty ideal, but a real, genuinely transformative practice.

This way of working has a knock-on effect: unified communities and inclusive policies lead to governance systems that can meaningfully respond to people’s actual needs.

* Check [Ampliando Democracia](https://ampliandodemocracia.org/en/home/) webpage for more information on our work.

### Civic tech for the common good

We design and promote digital tools that strengthen the democratic values of participation, transparency and accountability. Initiatives like What MPs Do, Electoral Assistant, Scanner 2030 and RTVE 2030 demonstrate how technology can bring politics down to earth, and demand higher standards of responsibility from our institutions.

We use open source software, and aim to build digital and public infrastructures that strengthen trust, amplify citizens’ voices and make democracy fairer, more open and more sustainable.

* Besides developing civic tech tools, such as [Qué Hacen Los Diputados](https://quehacenlosdiputados.es/) and [Scanner 2030](https://scanner2030.com/), we also support [IA Ciudadana](https://iaciudadana.org/), a coalition of 17 organizations that aims to strengthen the role of civil society in AI governance processes.

### Democratic ecosystems for a just transition

We’re breaking new ground at the intersection of democratic renewal and climate action. This is not a choice, but a necessity – the most significant challenges of our age can’t be tackled in Silos.

By using processes of public deliberation, collective intelligence and inter-sector alliances, we are designing scalable models that build legitimacy and trust for a just and fair ecological transition.

To support this work is to invest in a living project, one that is driving democratic infrastructures able to confront today’s planetary crises, and strengthen the democratic foundations of tomorrow.

* An example of our work on climate and democracy can be found in the summary of the event ["How to mainstream democracy"](https://politicalwatch.es/documentos/Report-Mainstream-Democracy.pdf).

### Public innovation that serves the people

We promote public innovation as a lever of transformation, working alongside institutions to make them more open, transparent and inclusive, and to bring them closer to the needs of the people.

From processes of open government to open parliaments and innovation labs, we co-create new forms of governance that are more dynamic and participatory. By innovating in service of the people, collaboration, participation and accountability form the beating heart of the system – and are not an add-on or exception to it.

* As part of our work in public innovation, we have promoted the [approval of Spain’s First Open Parliament Action Plan](https://politicalwatch.es/blog/habemus-parlamento-abierto).

### Dreaming, Weaving and caring for a hopeful future

We believe that social change is driven by hope and mutual support. Dreaming allows us to envisage a different future. Caring reminds us that change of any sort needs strong, nurturing bonds. Weaving means bringing together voices, knowledge, and experiences to build what we share in common.

We create spaces for uncomfortable but necessary conversations, where people can engage in dialogue with others who think differently. This is where learning and shared futures are born.

* One specific example of this vision is [our work in support of the Spanish Youth and Intergenerational Justice Law](https://politicalwatch.es/blog/greenpeace-political-watch-revo-prosperidad-sostenible-y-weall-iberia-se-reunen-con-la-ministra-de-juventud-e-infancia-para-impulsar-la-justicia-intergeneracional) (Ley de Juventud y Justicia Intergeneracional), which confronts the ecosocial crisis while also guaranteeing the rights of future generations.


## How we do it

### Research

We generate the expertise required to underpin the systemic changes we need, connecting democratic renewal to the greatest social and ecological challenges of our time. Beginning with data analysis, we draw up actionable proposals that work towards fair and ambitious public policies.

### Civic technologies

We make innovation work for the people by designing and rolling out digital tools that reinforce transparency, civic participation and accountability. In this way innovation becomes real public value. We are committed to using emerging technologies, and we specialise in extracting and analysing data using artificial intelligence. In addition, we are working to improve AI governance through the [IA Ciudadana coalition](https://iaciudadana.org/), the first of its kind in Europe.

### Advocacy and influence

We push for changes to public policy and institutional practice that give openness, inclusion and collaboration at the heart of governance. We build bridges to fight polarisation, fostering consensus and agreements on the foundations of democracy, and we champion public participation as a key driving force behind this transformation.

### Network Enabler

We act as a connector and catalyst, weaving together diverse actors across sectors and geographies, enabling ecosystems to flourish and building collaborative infrastructures that amplify impact, foster resilience, and sustain democratic ecosystems over time.
