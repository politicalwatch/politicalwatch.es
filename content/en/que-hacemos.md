### Research
We generate the expertise required to underpin the systemic changes we need, connecting democratic renewal to the greatest social and ecological challenges of our era. Beginning with data analysis, we draw up actionable proposals that work towards fair and ambitious public policies.

### Civic technologies
We make innovation work for the people by designing and rolling out digital tools that reinforce transparency, civic participation and accountability. In this way innovation becomes real public value. We are committed to using emerging technology, and we specialise in extracting and analysing data using artificial intelligence.

### Advocacy and influence
We push for changes to public policy and institutional practice that give openness, inclusion and collaboration a central role in governance. We build bridges to fight polarisation, fostering consensus and agreements on the foundations of democracy, and we champion public participation as a key driving force behind this transformation.

### Coordinating ecosystems
We create valuable connections, and weave networks of alliance that cover a vast range of different sectors – from activists to institutions, from social and cultural movements to academia and the private sector, and across many locations. By doing this, we build collaborative infrastructures that amplify the impacts of these areas, and support long-lasting democratic ecosystems. We firmly believe that we are stronger when we work towards a common goal, and when everyone is given a chance to play to their strengths.


## How we do it

### Democratic ecosystems for a just transition
We’re breaking new ground at the intersection of democratic renewal and climate action. This is not a choice, but a necessity – the most significant challenges of our age can’t be tackled one at a time.

By using processes of public deliberation, collective intelligence and inter-sector alliances, we are designing scalable models that build legitimacy and trust for a fair ecological transition.

To invest in this work is to support a living project, one that is pushing for democratic infrastructures that can respond to the global crises of today, and strengthen the democratic foundations of tomorrow.

### Dreaming, creating and caring for a hopeful future
We believe that social change is driven by hope and mutual support. Dreaming allows us to envisage a different future. Caring reminds us that change of any sort needs strong, nurturing bonds. Creating means unifying voices, knowledge and experience to build for the common good.

We create spaces for uncomfortable conversations, where people can engage in dialogue with others who think differently. This is where learning and a shared future is born.

One specific example of this vision is our work in support of the Youth and Intergenerational Justice Law (Ley de Juventud y Justicia Intergeneracional), which confronts the ecosocial crisis while also guaranteeing the rights of future generations.

### Public innovation that serves the people
We promote public innovation as a lever of transformation, working alongside institutions to make them more open, transparent and inclusive, and to bring them closer to the needs of the people.

From processes of open government to open parliaments and innovation labs, we co-create new forms of governance that are more dynamic and participatory. By innovating in service of the people, collaboration, participation and accountability form the beating heart of the system – not an add-on or exception to it.

### Civic tech for the common good
We design and promote digital tools that strengthen the democratic values of participation, transparency and accountability. Initiatives like What MPs Do, Electoral Assistant, Scanner 2030 and RTVE 2030 demonstrate how tech can bring politics down to earth, and demand higher standards of responsibility from our institutions.

We use open source software, and aim to build digital and public infrastructures that strengthen trust, amplify citizens’ voices and make democracy fairer, more open and more sustainable.

### Expanding Democracy
“Expanding Democracy” is an innovative platform that uses public participation to produce scalable democratic solutions. Through deliberation processes and collective intelligence, we connect actors from a range of sectors to nail down public policy proposals, and to create sustainable, democratic infrastructures. Our unique value proposal lies in turning civic dialogue into measurable impacts.

Backing this initiative means investing in stronger democracies that are better prepared for the challenges of today, such as the rise of authoritarianism. This project seeks a future where civic participation isn’t just some lofty ideal, but a real, genuinely transformative practice.

This way of working has a knock-on effect: unified communities and inclusive policies lead to governance systems that can meaningfully respond to people’s actual needs.
