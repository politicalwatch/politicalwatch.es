In a time of radical uncertainty, the new *Global State of Democracy Report* offers one of the clearest pictures of where democracy stands, and where it’s heading.

The findings are sobering:

* More than half of all countries assessed have declined in at least one core dimension of democracy over the past five years.  
* The four pillars (Representation, Rights, Rule of Law and Participation) are under strain, with unprecedented global declines in judicial independence, press freedom and electoral integrity.  
* Even long-standing democracies are not immune, as political shifts and weakening institutions challenge assumptions about resilience.

In Europe, the picture is no less troubling. Between 2019 and 2024, the region recorded 63 declines and only 23 advances across democratic factors. The steepest setbacks came in Civil Liberties and Credible Elections. Even well-established democracies are not immune to these pressures.

This year’s edition also shines a spotlight on democracy and migration. With over 300 million people now living outside their country of birth, the report examines how inclusive out-of-country voting can strengthen democratic resilience, and why more needs to be done to ensure meaningful participation for citizens abroad.

As members of the Global Democracy Coalition, we follow these reports closely. They remind us why strengthening democratic governance remains an urgent collective task.
