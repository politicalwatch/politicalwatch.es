The world is today more democratic than ever. However, at a global level democracies erode in their performance and quality. The regression in civil liberties, are added to the citizens deep disenchantment that see how economic crisis, the corruption cases, the rise of unemployment rates and the increment of inequality. All of this concur with the reappearance of xenophobic and nationalist movements, the polarization of politic speeches, the fake news and why not, a global pandemic.

For all of this, from Political Watch we believe we are in a turning point where is needed to fuel and renew the democratic values with the goal to design democracy models that match the challenges and the reality we live in.

So, we work for building an inclusive, fair and sustainable democratic moment, where the citizen participation is the norm and the politic class is subdued to the constant scrutiny of the citizenship, with open and capable governments able to react upon the different global challenges of our age.

### The importance of transparency: information and data, public and accessible

We work to promote an open and transparent State, that brings easy and complete access to information and public data about the work being done. For that we develop technological tools that bring closer the State to the citizenship, as we ally with other organizations and collectives to demand bigger transparency and accessibility.

### There is no democracy without an active and watchful citizenship

No State is open without an open and vindictive citizenship of their rights. We work to raise awareness and empower the citizenship to fulfill their essential in the surveillance of the political class, to demand a better accountability and fulfillment of the made commitments.

### Accountability as an impulse to democracy

We believe accountability by the political class is an essential part of democracy, as it allows the citizens to learn and evaluate the work if their representatives. For this reason, we watch politicians and in alliance with other organizations of the civil society, we impulse campaigns to demand the political class a permanent, transparent and honest communication with the citizenship.

### Public incidence

If we want to change how politics are made, we have to innovate in how to make incidence

In front of the traditional lobby practices, public incidence raises a new way to influence – more transparent and open – from civil society in the decision making processes. With our incidence projects, we look for the politic representatives to publicly commit with the social claims and proposals, to demand later to fulfill the commitments. In them, without avoiding criticizm, we focus in constructive proposals for improvement, but making sure that the non-fulfillment have a public cost.
