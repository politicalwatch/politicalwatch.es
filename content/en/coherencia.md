The big challenges of our era are complex and multidimensional. Their variables are so interconnected that any lasting and real solution will be holistic and transversal or will not be.

Before this panorama, the coherence raises as inalienable: we need politics where the economic, social and environmental instruments feed back to the achievement of a more sustainable, democratic and fairer society.

At Political Watch we work so governments, companies and the civil society understand better the interactions between politics and how their decisions of today can affect the well-being and sustainable development of future generations and people living in other countries.

We know how that designing and implementing coherent politics is an important challenge, that requires large amounts of political will and information. We work so the lack of knowledge stops being and obstacle in its achievement.

### 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable development

The 2030 Agenda is a global roadmap to give answer to poverty and the global challenges of sustainable development. With it, the international community has agreed for the first time in a set of goals and common priorities that are indivisible and are interconnected.

In relation with the 2030 Agenda, coherence implies considering the effects of the politics in the human wellness from a triple perspective: en the current generations in our own territory, in the future generations and the people who live in other countries.

In Political Watch we watch (from the analysis and citizen surveillance) so the countries and territories, in their process of achieving the SDGs, do not cause negative impacts in the sustainable development perspective of other countries, specially in countries in development. And so that, when moving forward in the achievement of the SDGs, generate positive externalities over other countries and over the global public goods.

### Commerce, investment and development

The international commerce generates and destroys economic and social oportunities in all the planet. Its size is such that for the developing countries the income for commerce is three times bigger to the sum of all development aid, the debt forgiveness and the remittances they receive.

The rules that govern international commerce are a key element in the design of the development policies and in the fight against poverty. They stablish the limits to the political space the countries have to govern in the defense of the common interest and their agreements stablish the balance between rights and obligations of the public powers and the private sector. For that reason, Political Watch works analyzing the trading politics and their impact in the sustainable development.

For decades, the trading liberalization has been promoted as an end itself and not like a tool subject to the achievement of the common good. The resulting trading system is custom-designed for the benefit of a few interests and lacks the mechanisms needed to manage their impacts over society.

A multilateral organized, balanced and fair trading system is a “global public good” we can not give up. Its achievement is one of the few big unfulfilled promises of the international community so far in the 21st century.

In the international tradinv scope and the foreign investment, from Political Watch we carry projects for:

* Know the implications the trading politics have over the expectations of sustainable development of third countries.
* Analyze the inclusion and approach of sustainable development in the international trading and investiment treaties.
* Look out the impact over the human rights of the investment of Spanish companies in countries in development.
